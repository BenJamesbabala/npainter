# Npainter 

Artistic patterns using recurrent neural network.
We use recurrent neural network that takes coordinate (x, y) and outputs RBG value to generate the patterns.
[recurrent.js] (https://github.com/karpathy/recurrentjs) used for RNN with the power of webworker and the result is cool artistic patterns.

You can try [Npainter](https://rupeshs.github.io/npainter/)

To test infinte style patterns change following parameters

1.Number of neurons per layer

2.Number of hidden layers

3 Stroke strength

Different non linearity functions used to generate patterns.
